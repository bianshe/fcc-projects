            Maryam Mirzakhani was an Iranian mathematician and a
            professor of mathematics at Stanford University. Her
            research topics included Teichm√ºller theory, hyperbolic
            geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry.

              "I don't have any particular recipe [for developing new
              proofs] ... It is like being lost in a jungle and 
              trying to use all the knowledge that you can gather to
              come up with some new tricks, and with some luck, you
              might find a way out."

            <li>
              <strong>In 1994</strong>, Mirzakhani achieved the gold
              medal level in the International Mathematical Olympiad
              in Hong Kong, scoring 41 out of 42 points. She was the
              first female Iranian student to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In 1995</strong>, she became the first Iranian
                student to achieve a perfect score and to win two
                gold medals in the International Mathematical
                Olympiad held in Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In 1999</strong>, she obtained a Bachelor of
              Science in mathematics from the Sharif University of
              Technology. During her time there, she received
              recognition from the American Mathematical Society for
              her work in developing a proof for Shor's Algorithm.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In 2004</strong>, she earned a PhD from Harvard
              University, where she worked under the supervision of
              the Fields Medalist Curtis T. McMullen.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In 2009</strong>, she became a professor at
              Stanford University.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In 2013</strong>, Mirzakhani was diagnosed with

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In 2014</strong>, with Alex Eskin and with
              input from Amir Mohammadi, Mirzakhani proved that
              complex geodesics and their closures in moduli space
              are surprisingly regular, rather than irregular or
              fractal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In 2014</strong>, Mirzakhani was awarded the
              Fields Medal for "her outstanding contributions to the
              dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their
              moduli spaces". The award was made in Seoul at the
              International Congress of Mathematicians on 13 August.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In 2016</strong>, Maryam Mirzakhani was made a
              member of the National Academy of Sciences, making her
              the first Iranian woman to be officially accepted as a
              member of the academy.
            </li>

              She died on <strong>14 July 2017</strong> at the age of
              40 at Stanford Hospital in Stanford, California.
